# GameCore

Currently in development.

This is meant to be a generalized server to synchronize objects across clients using events over WebSockets with restrictions in place to filter the events being sent to the clients. The intent is for this to be reusable by specifying the objects to be synchronized and providing general client management with the potential to add world simulation in the back-end in whatever way becomes necessary.

Also currently in development is the GameUI project meant to act as a generalized starting point for creation of interfaces with this project.
